A long time ago, in a far away galaxy, before alphabets and symbols were trapped under our fingers tortured by syntax errors and obnoxious people.

The inhabitants of Pondville lived peacefully. They believed in all powerful AgileForce and worshipped Gods to protect them from the evils of incorrect syntax and poor variable naming. Until one day Bank, a powerful demigod decided to call a list of numbers squickly and forgot to close a squiggly bracket.

This caused an uproar in the dotClass community. Their leader, Lord Synerr lead a revolution against all demigods to bring an end to programming languages as we know them.

The dotClass community was broken into three different factions, the Hips, the Logics, and the Antibank.

The Hips consisted of Toonice, Whoa, Squadgoals, Noteight, Playboy and Ytho. Ytho has lately been troubled with his existence and one day might be an apprentice to Mr.Synerr as he is only used in scripts and never had a real job.

The Logics consisted of Duodots, Leftover, Chinkhat, Virgin(hymen,hyphen get it?), Smoothop, Arr, and Params. Params too was turning to the dark side. He had been rather disturbed to what he had done to Arr on that fateful day. Arr didn't mind because it had happened to him occasionally. Params experiences on graphing calculators had left him with PTSD and he wanted to end destroy all demigods who had commited crimes that Bank had. Sometime during the uproar Leftover lost his eyesight and became Slash.

Finally, the Antibanks, they consisted of Descrims, Mullah, Coldpostal, Dotcomma, and the all powerful Lord Synerr. Dotcomma kept in touch with Duodots. A part of him wanted all Demigods to burn in hell but a part of him had understood that Demigods are far from perfect and that's what allowed them to create Pondville.
